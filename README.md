# Smart-Screen-Lock-System
## A complex project involving two Arduino Unos, one Arduino Nano and a Raspberry Pi.<br/> Consisting of three modules:
* The Locking Node
* The RFID Communications Node.
* The Display Node.

## RFID Communications Node
My RFID Reader and Communication node used an MFRC522 contactless RF reader, an NRF24L01+ radio transceiver, and Arduino Nano, an Arduino Uno and two LEDs with resistors, as can be seen below.
